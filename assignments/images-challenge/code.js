 * This code is running in an environment the same as simple-draw. Thus you have

 *
 *  width - the width of the drawing are
 * +.
 * 
 * a.
 *  height - the height of the drawing area.
 *
 * And these methods which do the same thing as in simple-draw.
 *
 *  drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, color, lineWidth)
 *
 *  drawCircle(x, y, radius, color, lineWidth=1)
 *
 *  drawRect(x, y, w, h, color, lineWidth=1)
 *
 *  drawTriangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, color, lineWidth=1)
 *
 *  drawFilledCircle(x, y, r, color)
 *
 *  drawFilledRect(x, y, width, height, color)
